1. Find the maximum and minimum enrollment across all sections, considering only sections that had some enrollment, 
don't worry about those that had no students taking that section

select max(count_sec), min(count_sec)
from
(select S.course_id, (select count(T.course_id)
                      from takes T
                      where T.sec_id = S.sec_id
                      and T.course_id = S.course_id
                      and T.semester = S.semester
                      and T.year = S.year) as count_sec
from section S)
as subquery
where count_sec > 0
