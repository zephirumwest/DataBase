2. Find all sections that had the maximum enrollment (along with the enrollment), using a subquery.

create view subquery as
select *, (select count(T.course_id)
           from takes T
           where T.sec_id = S.sec_id
           and T.course_id = S.course_id
           and T.semester = S.semester
           and T.year = S.year) as count_sec
from section S

select *
from subquery
where count_sec = (select max(count_sec) from subquery)
