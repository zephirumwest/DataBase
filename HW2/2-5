5. Find instructors who have taught all the above courses

5-1. Using the "not exists ... except ..." structure

select *
from instructor I
where not exists (
    select C.course_id
    from course C
    where C.course_id like 'CS-%'
)
except
(
    select T.course_id
    from teaches T
    where T.i_id = I.i_id
)

5-2 Using matching of counts which we covered in class(don't forget the distinct clause!).

select I.*
from Instructor as I
join (
    select T.i_id, count(distinct C.course_id) as taught_course_count
    from teaches T
    join course C on T.course_id = C.course_id
    where C.course_id like 'CS-%'
    group by T.i_id
) as taught_counts on I.i_id = taught_counts.i_id
where taught_counts.taught_course_count = (
    select count(distinct course_id)
    from course
    where course_id like 'CS-%'
)
