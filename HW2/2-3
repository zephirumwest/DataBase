3. As in in Q1, but now also include sections with no students taking them; the enrollment for such sections should be treated as zero. 
Do this in two different ways. 

3-1.Using a scalar subquery

select max(
  select count(T.course_id)
  from takes T
  where T.sec_id = S.sec_id
  and T.course_id = S.course_id
  and T.semester = S.semester
  and T.year = S.year)) as max,
  min((select count(T.course_id)
  from takes T
  where T.sec_id = S.sec_id
  and T.course_id = S.course_id
  and T.semester = S.semester
  and T.year = S.year)) as min
from section S

3-2 Using aggregation on a left outer join(use the SQL natural left outer join syntax)

create view count_id as (
  select count(id)
  from section
  natural left outer join takes
  group by course_id, sec_id, semester, year)

select max(count), min(count) from count_id
